# License_Plate_Detection

Automatic License Plate using Deep Learning.
Uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning object detection architecture based on Convolution neural networks for detection.
Prepares a custom dataset of 700 images of cars using LabelImg.
Segments the detected plates using pre-processing functions.
Uses Multilayer Perceptron(MLP) over a dataset of images: numbers 0-9 and alphabets.
